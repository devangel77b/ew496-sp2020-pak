\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Some organisms rely on their antennae to determine the position or texture of objects around them and, more importantly, how to maneuver around them. Cockroaches (Blattidae) have tiny, hair-like sensors on their antennae that are connected to neurons that communicate messages to the brain. These messages are sent down their neural pathways in electrical spikes called action potentials. This paper analyzes existing studies and determines how one could create a neural interface with a cockroach by stimulating spikes in its antennae. The product of this neural interface is the understanding of and access to the cockroaches' motor skills, steering cockroaches left or right and controlling speed, depending on the stimulation. The proximate aims of this project are to steer a cockroach, control the speed of the cockroach, and to evaluate the feasibility of a future lab exercise involving cyborg cockroaches. The ultimate aims are to learn neurophysiological and neuromechanical principles which may be applicable in restoring human function. The work described here was planned for Spring 2020, but due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, is now slated for Fall 2020.
