\section{Results}

%For results talk about what you would measure.

To determine the results of the experiment, I would conduct the experiment on each cockroach. Ideally, I would have at least 10 cockroaches to test on. For each experiment, I would use a timer to measure the time it took for a cockroach to react to the stimulation and the electrical tape to measure the angle of turn. 

\bigskip

With the cockroaches that successfully turn left and right when stimulated, I will place them on track made of thin strips of electrical tape consisting of straight paths and \ang{90} turns and observe their ability to make it all the way through.

% What else should I measure?

% With the Backyard Brains kit, all I can do is swipe left and right to make it turn left and right. Is there a way I can adjust the amount of current I'm sending to see varied responses? Is there a way to get them to move forward?
